# My Portfolio Website
# Description
My Portfolio Website is a personal website that showcases my skills, projects, and experience to potential employers or clients. The website is built using Next.js, a React-based framework for building server-side rendered web applications, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for styling.

# Installation
To run the website locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can download the website files from the GitHub repository and run the following commands in your terminal:

# bash
Copy code
cd my-portfolio-website
npm install # or yarn install
npm run dev # or yarn dev
This will start the development server, and you can view the website by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

# Features

# Projects

# Contact

# Customization
You can easily customize the website by modifying the files in the "src" folder. For example, you can change the content of the pages, add new pages, or modify the styling using Tailwind CSS.

You can also deploy the website to a hosting service of your choice, such as Vercel, by following the deployment instructions for Next.js.
